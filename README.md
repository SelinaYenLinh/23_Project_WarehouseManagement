## Overview

This project is an Excel VBA-based system designed to track and standardize the transportation process of company trucks from factory pickup to port delivery. It provides verified journey data, GPS image evidence, and delivery confirmation to improve coordination between factories and logistics partners.

## Motivation

In the existing workflow, shipment tracking and delivery confirmation were handled manually. This created inconsistencies in records, delayed verification processes, and increased the risk of disputes between stakeholders. A centralized and automated tracking system was required to ensure transparency and operational efficiency.

## Problem Statement

Without a unified tracking solution:

* Shipment confirmation depended on manual communication.
* Journey records were fragmented and difficult to verify.
* Lack of GPS evidence reduced data reliability.
* Delays and disputes were difficult to investigate.
* Operational time and cost increased due to repeated reconciliation.

## Solution

A structured Excel VBA system was developed to automate journey recording, store verifiable data, and standardize documentation for shipment tracking.

## Key Features

* Record truck arrival time at the factory
* Log loading start and departure time
* Track travel distance and journey details
* Store GPS image evidence of pickup vehicles
* Record arrival time at the port
* Confirm container drop-off time
* Generate automated reconciliation reports
* Standardize data entry and documentation workflow

## Process Impact

* Faster shipment confirmation and document processing
* Improved transparency between factory and logistics partners
* Reduced manual verification and operational delays
* Enhanced traceability of transportation history
* Lower risk of data discrepancies and disputes

## Technologies Used

* Microsoft Excel
* VBA (Visual Basic for Applications)
* Automated data entry forms
* Structured reporting system
* GPS image documentation integration

## Role & Responsibilities

* Analyzed operational workflow and requirements
* Designed data structure and tracking logic
* Developed VBA automation modules
* Built input forms and reporting templates
* Implemented and optimized the tracking process

## Result

The system streamlined shipment coordination, improved verification accuracy, and established a standardized process for tracking truck journeys from factory to port.
